			<p>Morphine is a website blocker with a twist. Instead of allotting a certain amount of time each day for using blocked sites, Morphine gives you a "balance" to pull from, which is very slowly filled with minutes. This allows you to use your blocked sites whenever you want for as long as you want&mdash;provided you have enough time in your balance. In other words: Regulated Distraction&trade;&reg;!</p>
			
			<p>But why take this approach? Well, let's say you're at work and have a standard website blocker turned on. A friend sends you a link to an item on one of your blocked sites, but when you try to access it, turns out you've already used all your daily allotted time up! However if you were using Morphine, your wait would be no more than 10 minutes (by default), since the balance is always slowly being added to.</p>
			
			<p>Ready to get started? Using the balance is very easy. Once you've set the options above to your taste, click on the Morphine icon in the toolbar or try to visit a blocked site. A page with a few large buttons with numbers will be displayed&mdash;these represent minutes. Click one to add that number to the "meter". Once the meter is used up, the sites will return to being blocked.</p>
